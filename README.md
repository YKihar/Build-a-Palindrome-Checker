# Palindrome Checker

## Project Description

This web application checks if a given string is a palindrome (a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case). It was built to practice and demonstrate skills in JavaScript, focusing on string manipulation and algorithmic thinking. This project provides a practical example of working with strings and implementing a common algorithm.

## Key Features

*   **Palindrome Check:** Users can input a string, and the application will determine if it's a palindrome.
*   **Ignores Case and Non-Alphanumeric Characters:** The application normalizes the input string by converting it to lowercase and removing any non-alphanumeric characters (spaces, punctuation, etc.) before checking for palindromes.
*   **Clear Output:** The application provides clear feedback to the user, indicating whether the input string is a palindrome or not.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** The interface is designed for ease of use, making it simple for users to input strings and see the results.
